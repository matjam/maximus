Tue May 13 02:00:27 EDT 2003 - Maximus/UNIX 3.02 

	Initial Release, so Tony Summerfelt can play with squish.
	Current Status: Squish "works for me"

Sat May 24 00:50:45 EDT 2003 - Maximus/UNIX 3.03a

	Initial Public Release. Bumped version number 3.03 to avoid confusion.
	Current Status: Everything but Maximus "works for me"

	Major Problem Areas:
		- No Installer
		- Local console output is buggy (always one keystroke behind)
		- fdcomm.so comm driver is buggy and does not speak telnet 
		- fdcomm.so comm driver only allows one concurrent session
		- MexVM crashes regularly on 64-bit arch. Don't know about 32-bit.

	Problems Fixed:
		- Too many to mention.

	Added Features:
		- max -p2000 makes Maximus listen on TCP port 2000
		- Added more options to master makefile; now tries to
		  compiler Maximus control files during make install
		- Added a simple ./configure script, to try and reduce
		  confusion among users.
