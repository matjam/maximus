Tue May 13 02:00:27 EDT 2003 - Maximus/UNIX 3.02 

	Initial Release, so Tony Summerfelt can play with squish.
	Current Status: Squish "works for me"

Sat May 24 00:50:45 EDT 2003 - Maximus/UNIX 3.03a

	Initial Public Release. Bumped version number 3.03 to avoid confusion.
	Current Status: Everything but Maximus "works for me"

	Major Problem Areas:
		- No Installer
		- Local console output is buggy (always one keystroke behind)
		- fdcomm.so comm driver is buggy and does not speak telnet 
		- fdcomm.so comm driver only allows one concurrent session
		- MexVM crashes regularly on 64-bit arch. Don't know about
		  32-bit.

	Problems Fixed:
		- Too many to mention.

	Added Features:
		- max -p2000 makes Maximus listen on TCP port 2000
		- Added more options to master makefile; now tries to
		  compiler Maximus control files during make install
		- Added a simple ./configure script, to try and reduce
		  confusion among users.

Fri Jun  6 20:22:09 EDT 2003 - Maximus/UNIX 3.03b [pre-release]

	- Incorporated 3.03a-patch1, which added 7-bit NVT (telnet capability)
	  to the listening socket, and allowed multiple users at once. This
	  capability requires a dynamic node number; max -n0.

	- Incorporated FreeBSD & Linux build advice/fixes from Andrew Clarke
	  and Bo Simonsen.

	- Incorporated changes to msgapi from Bo Simonsen; some code in the
  	  changes originates from The Husky Project. Changes should allow
	  Squish bases to be binary-compatible with other software's Squish
	  bases. Bo also removed an empty echomail kludge line in Maximus, 
	  and added a local Seen-By.

	- Modified comdll API to COMMAPI_VER=2.  This allows Maximus to make
	  intelligent use of the Nagle algorithm, turning it on and off as 
	  appropriate. COMMAPI_VER=2 also allows us to not send modem commands
	  at communication handles which aren't attached to modems.

	- Added BINARY-TRANSFER NVT option which should negotiate 8-bit clear
	  NVT sessions with clients that support the option. This should allow
	  users the ability to use download protocols. Feedback requested.

	- Major work to configuration engine; should do a better job setting
	  parameters and informing users of problems.

	- Support for GNU Make 3.76 deprecated; 3.79+ is recommended.

	- Added -fpermissive to g++ CXXFLAGS to quell warnings about non-
	  comforming C++ code.

	- Now builds under Solaris 8/SPARC; however, disk-based data structs
	  are still backwards (wrong endian). This means that it may not work,
	  and if it does it won't toss FTSC packets, nor will it interoperate
	  with other Maximus/Squish products. Solaris-x86 may work fine, but
	  it has not however been tested.

	- Many other changes -- see CVS for complete details.

Wed Jun 11 11:01:10 EDT 2003, Maximus/UNIX 3.03b [pre-release]

	- More changes to allow support for Sparc and other BIG_ENDIAN 
	  platforms. Data files are still not binary compatible with other
	  systems, BEWARE. The Sparc port is at where it is right now in 
	  order to help me debug the code body; My sun is fast and has a
	  pleasant development environment, where as my old RedHat
	  5.2, Alpha UDB box is NOT fast and does NOT have the 
	  development environment I enjoy.

	- Massive work done on configure script and Makefile rules, to allow
	  a cleaner "from-scratch" build. Now we detect platform endianness 
	  rather than trying to read it from C header files (this was causing 
	  problems for Vince Koen and Andrew Clarke). Make configure_install
	  should now be smart enough to rebuild all maximus control files
	  into a useable state, but (theoretically) not overwrite anything
	  you need.

	- Changed struct _stamp to union _stampu and (hopefully) adjusted
	  code appropriately. This should allow proper sizing, comparison,
	  and endianness of the dos date/time stamps, union stamp_combo,
	  etc. under non-x86 hardware.

	- Fixed lack-of-responsiveness in keyboard/video driver in max -c
	  and max -k modes, but introduced a bug where the cursor is often
	  positioned one linefeed lower than it ought to be.

	- Integrated patches from Andrew Clarke to allow building under
	  FreeBSD.

	- Many other changes; see CVS for details.

Wed Jun 11 23:58:30 EDT 2003, Maximus/UNIX 3.03b [tagged release]

	- Changes to build under GNU CC 3.2. Biggest problem stems from the
          requirement for a new shared library when executing C++ code as
	  of GCC 3.0. This means that programs with C++ components must
	  either link the library with 'gcc', or be linked with g++.
	  Unfortunately, GNU Make (3.79.1) doesn't know (and can't know?)
	  anything about this, so the default (implicit) rules get broken.

	- Changes to try and detect whether to declare timer_t.

	- Changes to the configuration scripts for (yet again) cleaner
	  building. Extensive from-scratch with my buddy's uber-fast
	  box. I think it's RedHat 8.0.

	- Bugs fixed with respect to non-/var/max install PREFIX

	- Many other changes; see CVS for details.
