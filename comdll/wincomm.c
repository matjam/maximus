/**
 * @file 	wincomm.c	WinNT-style Comm functions for UNIX
 * @author 	Wes Garland
 * @date	May 13 2003
 * @description	Fudge routines/hooks for the comm library and asyncnt.c.
 * 		Designed to replace WinNT functions of the same names.
 *  
 * $Log: wincomm.c,v $
 * Revision 1.6  2004/06/07 17:41:37  paltas
 * Fixed dynamic port speed
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/07/05 01:03:43  wesgarland
 * Robustification: Do not core if we are passed NULL handles
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/06/30 05:25:33  wesgarland
 * Minor silly errors corrected
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/06/29 20:48:59  wesgarland
 * Changes made to allow pluggable communications module. Code in not currently
 * pluggable, but "guts" will be identical to pluggable version of telnet
 * and raw IP plugins.
 *
 * Changed representation of COMMHANDLE (and deprecated OSCOMMHANDLE) in wincomm
 * code (pseudo Win32 communications API), to allow the potential for multiple
 * comm handles, better support UNIX comm plug-ins, etc.
 *
 * Added functions to "Windows" communications API which are normally handled by
 * the assignment operator -- those are possible under Win32 because the
 * underlying representation by which all comm data is accessed (e.g. word
 * length, parity, buffer sizes) is an integer (not unlike a UNIX file
 * descriptor), but under UNIX a COMMHANDLE is an incomplete struct pointer.
 * Using these routines instead of "inside" knowledge should allow new code
 * written for UNIX to be backported to Windows (and maybe other OSes) easily.
 *
 * This check-in is "barely tested" and expected to have bugs.

/** UNIX approximation for information referenced in Windows by
 *  an hfComm/COMMHANDLE. In Windows, this is basically like a
 *  file descriptor (HFILE) with the extra settings being magically
 *  returned by some internal table in the kernel. We abstract this
 *  away from a plain file descriptor for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. To contain the required information without keeping track
 *     of some magic internal table
 *
 *  2. To insure that we use the correct functions to coerce one
 *     type from another, rather than casting. This forces us
 *     (at compile time, hopefully) to use the correct routines
 *     for opening/closing a comm handle.
 *
 *  The extra information in Windows is somewhat like like ioctl
 *  or the POSIX termios details the tty device driver holds;
 *  by they are not quite the same. So getting them from the
 *  structures, and setting them to the structures + termios
 *  gives us a good, portable implementation -- across unices
 *  -and- other platforms.

/** Translates an HFILE into a COMMHANDLE.

 *  Under NT, they seem to be equivalent types, much like
 *  UNIX file descriptors. However, we maintain more
 *  information with COMMHANDLEs than just the file descriptor
 *  under UNIX, because we want to be able to retrieve things
 *  like the DCB which are controlled via the COMMHANDLE, and
 *  presumably handled by file descriptor in the NT kernel.
 *
 *  An alternate implementation might be to statically store
 *  the "related" information into an array indexed by file 
 *  descriptor. That seems really inelegant to me, although
 *  it *would* allow passing around a raw file descriptor
 *  if that was needed. Either way, using the libcomm routines
 *  to translate between the two data types (even if that
 *  translation routine boils down to the assignment operator)
 *  allows either implementation without breaking the API -- as
 *  long as the comm libraries and compat libraries are updated
 *  simulataneously.
