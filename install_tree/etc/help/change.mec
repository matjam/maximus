[/CCity yellow]        CITY

        [white]This command changes the contents of the "city" field
in your user record. [goto Next]

[/Password yellow]        PASSWORD

        [white]This command changes your password.  Before entering a
new password, you must correctly enter your current password.  It's a
good idea to change your password every few months to deter attempts
to gain access to your account. [goto Next]

[/Help yellow]        HELP LEVEL

        [white]This command changes your "help level".  Maximus supports
the following four help levels:

        [yellow]NOVICE   - [white]Full menus.
        [yellow]REGULAR  - [white]Abbreviated menus.
        [yellow]EXPERT   - [white]No menus.
        [yellow]HOTFLASH - [white]Full-screen, hotkey interface. [goto Next]

[/Nulls yellow]        NULLS

        [white]This command changes the delay after each transmitted
line.  Unless you're using an ancient terminal, you probably won't need
to use this setting. [goto Next]

[/Width yellow]        WIDTH

        [white]This command changes your screen width setting.  If the
width you give here is incorrect, messages and menus won't be
displayed properly. [goto Next]

[/LLength yellow]        LENGTH

        [white]This command changes your screen length setting.  If
this length is incorrect, then the `More [[Y,n]?' prompts won't be displayed
in the right places. [goto Next]


[/Tabs yellow]        TABS

        [white]This command toggles the translation of tab characters.
Normally, Maximus sends tabs unaltered.  A tab can replace up to eight
spaces, so using tabs may make your display marginally faster.  If
your terminal doesn't support tabs, you can tell Maximus to translate
tabs into spaces by turning the tabs option OFF. [goto next]

[/Mmore yellow]        MORE

        [white]This command can be used to turn off screen paging.
Normally, Maximus will display a "More [[Y,n,=]" prompt at the end
of every screen page.  However, if you're doing a lot of text
capturing, you can turn off these prompts by selecting this
option.  Also, you can temporarily turn off more prompts for one
file by selecting the `=' option at any existing more prompt. [goto Next]

[/Video yellow]        VIDEO MODE

        [white]This command can be used to change your current video
mode.  Currently, Maximus supports the TTY, ANSI and AVATAR video
modes.  Both ANSI and AVATAR support colour and cursor positioning,
but TTY mode is text-only. [goto Next]

[/ripgraph yellow]        RIP GRAPHICS

        [white]This command enables or disables RIP Graphics support.
RIP graphics allow you to see graphics and use the mouse to manipulate
menu options.

This feature is only available if the SysOp has enabled RIP graphics
support.  In addition, your terminal program must support RIP
graphics to use this option.[goto Next]

[/FSED yellow]        FULLSCREEN EDITOR

        [white]This command toggles the use of the full-screen editor.
The full-screen editor is more like a word processor than a BBS
editor; you can use the cursor keys to move around, insert and delete
text in the middle of paragraphs, and so on.  However, you need ANSI
or AVATAR graphics to use the full-screen editor, in addition to a
screen of at least 23 lines and 79 columns. [goto Next]

[/SClr yellow]        SCREEN CLEAR

        [white]This command toggles screen clearing codes.  If your
terminal can't handle the TTY clearscreen character (ASCII 12) or the
ANSI "2J" command, this option should be turned off. [goto Next]

[/IBM yellow]        IBM CHARACTERS

        [white]This command toggles the translation of IBM high-bit
characters.  IBMs and compatibles have an `extended' 8-bit character
set, including box-drawing characters and block graphics, accented
characters, and so on.  Most non-IBM systems don't support these
codes, so turning off this option causes Max to translate the high-bit
characters into an equivalent ASCII character. [goto Next]

[/PhoneNum yellow]        PHONE NUMBER

        [white]This command lets you modify the phone number in your
user record.  This command may be unavailable on certain systems. [goto Next]

[/HHotkeys yellow]        HOTKEYS

        [white]The Hotkeys command allows you to toggle the use of
hotkeys within Maximus.  When hotkeys are turned off, you must press
<enter> after each command letter.  However, if hotkeys are turned on,
Maximus will act on keystrokes as soon as they are received. [goto Next]

[/LLanguage yellow]        LANGUAGE

        [white]The Language command allows you to select an alternate
language file.  A list of available languages is displayed when you
select this command; simply choose a number to change to that language.
You can change language files at any point in the session. [goto Next]

[/ShowInUserList yellow]        SHOW IN USERLIST

        [white]This command allows you to select whether or not your
name will be shown in the system userlist.  If you don't want your
name to be displayed to others (for whatever reason), this option can
be turned off. [goto Next]

[/Protocol yellow]        PROTOCOL DEFAULT

        [white]This command allows you to select a default file
transfer protocol.  Normally, when performing an upload or a download,
Maximus will prompt you to select a protocol for each transfer.  However,
if you'll always be using the same protocol, you can select it
here on the change menu.  After a default protocol is selected, Max will
automatically assume that you want to use that protocol when performing
an upload or a download. [goto Next]

[/Archiver yellow]        ARCHIVER DEFAULT

        [white]This command allows you to select a default archiving
program.  When performing a QWK mail pack, Maximus will normally ask
you to select a compression method.  However, if you'll always be
using the same compression format when downloading mail, you can
select a default archiver using this option. [goto Next]

[/FullScrnRead yellow]        FULL-SCREEN READER

        [white]This command toggles the use of the Maximus
"full-screen reader".  This reader is identical to the header
used in the message entry command.  More information will be
displayed than in the default header, such as both the creation
and arrival dates, but the new header takes longer to display
on remote screens.  You must be using ANSI/AVATAR and have screen
clearing turned on for this option to work. [goto Next]

[/Alias yellow]        ALIAS

        [white]This command allows you to change your alias.
(Some systems may not have alias support enabled, so this
option may not be available to you.) [goto Next]
