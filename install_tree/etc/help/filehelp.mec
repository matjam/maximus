[/Area yellow]        AREA CHANGE

        [white]The Area Change command lets you change to another file
area.  Most systems have files divided into numerous categories
(utilities, graphics, music, etc.), so you can use this command to
access other file areas. [goto Next]

[/LLocate yellow]         LOCATE

        [white]The Locate command allows you to search ALL file areas
on the system for a particular filename or description.  The text you
type will be matched anywhere in the file name or description, so
wildcards are not needed.  If you specify "*" at the prompt, Max will
only list files which were added since the date of your last call. [goto Next]

[/File_Titles yellow]         FILE TITLES

        [white]The File Titles command displays a list of files and
descriptions for the current file area.  If you specify a "*" at
the prompt, Max will only list NEW files at the current area.  In
addition, you can also perform a search on the current area by
entering any text string at the prompt.  To list all files, simply
press <enter>. [goto Next]

[/View yellow]        VIEW

        [white]The View command allows you to display the contents of any ASCII
text file contained in the current area.  Since Type only works for ASCII
files, you cannot use this command to display an .EXE, .GIF, or anything
else except pure ASCII. [goto Next]

[/DDownload yellow]        DOWNLOAD

        [white]The Download command allows you to receive files from
the system, assuming your access level is high enough to perform this
command.  (Some systems may require validation before you're allowed
to download, so this command may or may not be present.)

        After selecting this command, Maximus may ask you to choose
a file transfer protocol.  (If you've selected a default protocol
in the C)hange menu, Max will go right to the next step.)

        Next, you can enter one or more filenames to be downloaded.
(To download more than one file at the same time, you must be using a
batch protocol such as Zmodem or SEAlink.)  If you've queued any files
with the TAG command, those files will be added to the current
transfer.  You may enter up to 30 filenames to be transferred at once.
Max will search ALL file areas for the filename you specify, so you
don't have to change areas before starting a download.

        When specifying filenames, you don't need to specify a file
extension.  If no extension is given, Max will automatically add a
".*" to the end of each file you specify.

        In addition to entering filenames, you can also enter several
commands at the download program.  The "/e" command can be used to
edit the filename list, "/q" can be used to abort the download, and
"/g" can be used to automatically log off after the download
completes.

        After entering the last filename, press <enter> to start the
transfer.  From that point, you should activate the downloading
function in your terminal program. [goto Next]

[/Upload yellow]        UPLOAD

        [white]The Upload command lets you send files to this system,
assuming that your access level is high enough to perform this
command.  (Some systems may require validation before you're allowed
to upload, so this command may or may not be present.)

        After selecting this command, Maximus may ask you to choose
a file transfer protocol.  (If you've selected a default protocol
in the C)hange menu, Max will go right to the next step.)

        If you're using a batch protocol (such as Zmodem or SEAlink),
Maximus will automatically start the upload.  Simply tell your program
the name of the file to send, and everything will be handled automatically.

        However, if you're using a non-batch protocol (such as Xmodem,
1K-Xmodem or ASCII), you must enter the name of the file that you're
about to send.  After doing so, you can then start the upload function
in your terminal program. [goto Next]

[include STATS.INC]

[/Contents yellow]        CONTENTS

        [white]The Contents command allows you to look at the contents
of a compressed file.  Contents will display the filenames, sizes,
dates, and other information about each file in the archive you
specify. The Contents command can view any .ZIP, .ARC, .PAK, .LZH or
.ARJ file; for other compression methods, you're on your own. [goto Next]

[/Tag yellow]        TAG

        [white]The Tag command allows you to queue a file for downloading
later in the current session.  Tagging a file simply adds it to an
internal list of "files to send".  Later, when you select the download
option, all of the files you tagged can be downloaded at the same time.

        Files can also be tagged while performing a file listing; you
can use the "t" command at a "More [[Y,n,=,t]?" prompt to tag one of
the files that you see on-screen.

        Up to 30 files may be tagged at one time.  When entering
filenames, wildcards ARE allowed, and files can be downloaded from
any area on the system. [goto next]

[/jjump yellow]        JUMP TO MESSAGES

        [white]This command will take you directly to the message
areas.  Instead of going back to the main menu and then selecting
M)essage, the Jump command allows you to directly switch between the
message and file sections. [goto next]
