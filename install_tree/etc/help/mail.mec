        [white]This is a "NetMail area".  You can use this area to
send mail to users on remote systems; by entering a FidoNet network
address, you can send a message almost anywhere in the world.

        However, sending NetMail costs money, so you'll probably have
to establish a line of credit with your SysOp before you can send
anything. [goto next]
