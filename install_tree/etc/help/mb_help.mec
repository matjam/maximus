[white]MEXBANK [lightgreen]is a time and download kilobyte banking facility which you may use
to accumulate left-over login time or download allocation from one session
to the next.  You can deposit any unused time or download allowance in one
session,  and withdraw it in another,  perhaps allowing you  to download a
file in the later session that you would not normally be able to access at
at your current level of access.

The main [white]MEXBANK [lightgreen]screen shows your current account balance, the amounts of
time  and  download bytes  currently available  to you,  and  the  maximum
amounts that you may currently deposit or withdraw from the bank.

[lightmagenta]Making a Deposit    [cyan]To deposit surplus time or download allowance,  select
                    [yellow]D[gray])eposit [cyan]from the main prompt,  choose between deposit
                    [yellow]T[gray])ime [cyan]or [yellow]B[gray])ytes[cyan], and enter the amount.

             [lightblue]NOTE:  [brown]Your sysop will probably have restricted the amount of
                    time and/or  bytes you are  allowed to deposit  during
                    any day,  and may also have specified a minimum amount
                    that  you must retain  for the current login.  If  the
                    amount you enter exceeds either of these preset limits
                    or is greater  than the amount  you have available  to
                    deposit,  you will be told so and the transaction will
                    be cancelled.

[lightmagenta]Making a Withdrawal [cyan]To withdraw time or download kilobytes  from the bank,
                    select [yellow]W[gray])ithdraw [cyan]from the main prompt,  choose between
                    withdraw [yellow]T[gray])ime [cyan]or [yellow]B[gray])ytes[cyan], and enter the amount.

             [lightblue]NOTE:  [brown]Your sysop will probably have restricted the amount of
                    time and/or  bytes you are  allowed to withdraw during
                    any day.  If the  amount you enter exceeds  either  of
                    these  preset limits,  or would exceed your  available
                    balance, you will be told so  and the transaction will
                    be cancelled.

[lightgreen]Changes to  your account and time  or download allocation  do not actually
take  place until  you select [yellow]Q[gray])uit[lightgreen].   At that time,  your transaction  is
recorded and your  time or download  allocation adjusted  before returning
you to the BBS menu.[gray]
