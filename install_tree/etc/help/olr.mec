[moreoff cls yellow]HELP for the OFFLINE READER

[white]The Maximus Offline Reader function allows you to pack up messages from
your areas of interest, download them, then read and reply to offline.
You then call back and upload your "reply bundle".  You will need
offline reader software to perform your reading and replying. The
Maximus Offline Reader function supports any QWK format reader. This
format is widely used and you will find your QWK reader will also work
with such systems as PC Board and Remote Access.  Two popular offline
readers are SLMR and XRS (with QWK conversion utility).  Check to see if
the sysop has these available for download.  Be sure to check out the
[lightcyan]Browse [white]and [lightcyan]Tag [white]functions.  Select any of the following functions for
more detailed information.

[/restdate yellow]        RESTRICT DATE

        [white]This command allows you to specify the minimum date
required to pack messages into a QWK packet.  Messages which arrived
on the system before the date that you specify will not be packed
into the QWK packet.  This setting remains in effect for the current
session only. [goto next]

[/tag yellow]        TAG AREA

        [white]Select which areas you would like to pack with the offline reader
using the "Download New Messages" function. [goto next]

[/ddownload yellow]        DOWNLOAD NEW MESSAGES

        [white]Maximus will pack all new messages in your Tagged areas (see TAG AREA
function), then present them for you to download.  Do not forget that
you can select a default download protocol from the CHANGE Menu (choose
at the MAIN Menu). [goto next]

[/upload yellow]        UPLOAD REPLIES

[white]After reading and replying offline, your offline reader will prepare a
bundle for upload called <bbsname>.REP.  This option is where you will
upload your reply bundle.  After the upload, Maximus will show you the
message headers as they are moved to the correct message areas.  Do not
forget that you can select a default upload protocol from the CHANGE
menu (choose at the MAIN Menu). [goto next]

[/protocol yellow]        PROTOCOL DEFAULT

        [white]You may specify your default file transfer protocol here.  Once you
select a protocol, it will be used for all file transfers to and from
the Maximus BBS and you will not be asked to select a protocol each time
you want to transfer messages or files. [goto next]

[/compress yellow]        ARCHIVER DEFAULT

        [white]You may specify your message compression method here.  Once you select a
compression method, you will not be asked to select a compression method
each time you download messages for your offline reader. [goto next]
