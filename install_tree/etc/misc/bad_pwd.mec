[lightred]You entered an invalid password!

[yellow]Do you want to leave a message to the SysOp explaining this situation?

[white]If you can convince the sysop that you are who you say you are (the
best way to do that would be to provide your real name, phone number,
and any other details that you may have entered in your original
log-on), he/she might be willing to give you a new password. 

If you do request a different password, it would be best to leave at
LEAST 72 hours before your log-on next attempt.  There are no
guarantees that changes will be made by then, but they're not likely
to be made before then either.

[yellow]Remember!  If you want [lightred blink]ANYTHING [yellow]done, make SURE to suggest an
alternate password!
