
Error!  An MS-DOS filename is from one to eight characters long, 
consisting of letters, numbers, and also any of the following 
characters: !@#$%^()_-  (Note that a space is NOT a valid 
character. Also, there is no difference between uppercase and 
lowercase characters.)

A filename can also have an optional period, followed by a three-character
extension.  The following are all examples of valid filenames:

abcdefgh
filename.ext
FiLeNaMe.ext
FILENAME.EXT
$$$NEW.ABC
