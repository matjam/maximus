
Your name was not found in my user records.  If you are indeed a new
user, then answer `Y' to the following prompt, and proceed to log on.
Otherwise, type `N' and enter your name correctly.

NOTE!  Please make sure that your name, as shown below, is
capitalized correctly!  Maximus will try to properly capitalize
names, if possible, but you must manually enter the correct version
of names such as "McDonald".  This is only necessary on your first
logon; subsequent logons will use the capitalization which you
specify here.
