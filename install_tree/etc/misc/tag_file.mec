
[yellow]TAG FILE

[white]The T)ag command is used to place filenames in a queue, and
defer the download of the files until a later point in the call.  In
other words, one can Tag/Add up to thirty files (even across file areas),
and then download all of the files in one fell swoop.

The special commands available on the Tag menu are:

    [yellow]A)dd -  [white]This option is used to ADD a file to the tag queue.
            (The file must be in the current area.)  One the
            file is tagged, Maximus will add the filename
            to its internal list, and display a short status
            report.  Wildcards ARE supported, but only
            30 files can be tagged at one time.

            Note: The ADD command can also be accessed by
            entering the "t" character from any
            "More [[Y,n,t,=]" prompt in the file areas.

    [yellow]L)ist - [white]This command will display a list of all files
            which were queued by the A)dd command, and
            the time required to download each file.

  [yellow]D)elete - [white]The Delete command will remote a specified
            file from the tag queue.  This option is
            useful if a file had been tagged previously,
            but is no longer required.

   [yellow]C)lear - [white]The Clear command removes all tagged files
            from the tag queue.
