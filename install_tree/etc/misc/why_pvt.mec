
Maximus is asking whether or not you want your message to be private.

`Private' doesn't necessarily mean that nobody else except the
recipient will read your message; the SysOp can read all messages
posted on the system, no matter who they are addressed to.  However,
your message will be safe from normal callers.

On the other hand, if you leave a public message, it can be read
by anyone.  Public messages are good for contacting more than one
person, since they can be read by anyone who comes into the message
area in question.

    If you wish to leave a PRIVATE message, enter.... Y
    If you wish to leave a PUBLIC message, enter..... N
