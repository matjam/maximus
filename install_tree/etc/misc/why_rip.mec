Maximus supports the Remote Imaging Protocol, otherwise known as
RIP. If your terminal program supports RIP, then you will be able to
view the BBS in graphics mode and use the mouse to make menu
selections.

However, your terminal program must have support for RIP, or else
you will only see a lot of strange codes, such as
"!|*|w0707241310|#|#|#" and so on. If your terminal program has a
terminal emulation mode which supports RIP graphics, you should
switch to it now.

If this screen has a frame, you do have RIP graphics capability, but
if you can only see an unintelligible series of numbers and symbols
preceeded by "!|" at the top of your screen, then your terminal
program does NOT support RIP graphics, and you should answer "N" at
the prompt.

   To turn *on* RIP graphics, enter ........... Y
   To turn *off* RIP graphics, enter .......... N
