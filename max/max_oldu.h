/*# name=Maximus USER.BBS structure definition
*/


/* NOTE:  This structure is semi-stable.  Although it is still compatible  *
 * with the old Opus 1.03 structure, don't expect it to stay that way      *
 * for long.  In a future version, Maximus will be using a dymaic-sized    *
 * user record, making it possible to make additions without breaking      *
 * preexisting software.  You can start to code for this now in your       *
 * software, as the usr.struct_len variable indicates the length of the    *
 * current user structure, divided by twenty.  This allows us to build up  *
 * a base of utilities, and be able to switch to a new format (while still *
 * not breaking anything) in the future.  Also, if usr.sruct_len==0, then  *
 * you MUST assume that the length of the structure is actually 180 bytes  *
 * long, as Opus (and Maximus v1.00 only) did not use this field.  In      *
 * other words:                                                            *
 *                                                                         *
 * len_of_struct=(usr.struct_len ? (usr.struct_len*20) : 180)              *
 *                                                                         *
 * In addition, you can assume that all user records in the user file are  *
 * the SAME size...  ie. You can just read the first user record out of    *
 * the file, and you are assured that the rest of the records in the file  *
 * area also the same size.                                                *
 *                                                                         *
 *                                                                         *
 * Example for reading in the dynamic-sized user structure:                *
 *                                                                         *
 *    {                                                                    *
 *      struct _usr users[MAX_USERS];                                      *
 *                                                                         *
 *      int x,                                                             *
 *          userfile,                                                      *

 *      {                                                                  *
 *        lseek(userfile,(long)x*(long)s_len,SEEK_SET);                    *
 *        read(userfile,&users[x],sizeof(struct _usr));                    *
 *      }                                                                  *
 *                                                                         *
 *      close(userfile);                                                   *
 *    }                                                                    *
 *                                                                         *
 * If anything is added to the user structure, it will be appended to the  *
 * END of the structure, so you can be assured that the offsets of each    *
 * individual variable will NOT change.                                    *
 *                                                                         *
 * Also, when ADDING or DELETING users, certain special operations have    *
 * to be performed, mainly those related to the lastread pointers.  When   *
 * adding a user, the procedure is fairly simple; just make sure that      *
 * usr.lastread_ptr is a unique number, different from all others in       *
 * USER.BBS.  Although Max uses a somewhat complicated algorithm to        *
 * fill gaps in the user file, most utility programs can just read through *
 * USER.BBS, and keep a running tally of the HIGHEST usr.struct_len        *
 * variable.  Once you have that, increment it by one, and stuff it into   *
 * the usr.struct_len of the user to be added.                             *
 *                                                                         *
 * When DELETING users, you must go through the process of "cleansing"     *
 * the lastread pointers for the user you deleted.  The procedure for this *
 * is simple:  For every area listed in AREAS.CTL, open the LASTREAD.BBS   *
 * file for that area, and seek to the offset...                           *
 *                                                                         *
 *    usr.lastread_ptr*(long)sizeof(int)                                   *
 *                                                                         *
 * ...and write *two* NUL bytes (ASCII 00).                                *
 *                                                                         *
 * Please note that you do NOT need to do anything special to sort the     *
 * user file...  Since the lastread offset is stored in usr.lastread_ptr,  *
 * you can sort the user file with impunity, and even use old Opus 1.03    *
 * sort utilities.                                                         */
