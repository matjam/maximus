Maximus can display the contents of any .ARC, .PAK, .ZIP, .LZH or .ARJ
file.  Files with one of those extensions contain one or more
compressed files; these files are kept together for making file
transfers easier.  Just type in the base name of the archive, and
Maximus will display the archive's contents.  (No explicit file
extension is necessary.)
