Maximus has a `hotkeys' capability; this allows the user to select
menu options without having to press <enter> after each selection.

Normally, to Y)ell for the system operator, one would have to type "Y"
and then <enter> at the main menu.  However, if hotkeys are turned on,
the yell command would be activated after pressing "Y" (without an
<enter> keystroke).

        To enable hotkeys, type............  Y
        If you don't want hotkeys, type....  N
